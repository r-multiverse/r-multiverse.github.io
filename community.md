## An Open Repository for R Packages

Packages are available for installation from the repository at <https://community.r-multiverse.org>.

A traditional software version cycle begins with the development phase, where bugs are identified and fixed, and ends with the production phase, which promises a seamless user experience.

Community aims at a space just before production, commonly referred to as Quality Assurance (QA).
This means that:

1. Each package release has the full endorsement of its own maintainer.
R-multiverse always provides a version that its developer chose to distribute for general use.
2. The user is still responsible for judging whether a package is appropriate to use.
Some releases may still have issues, as indicated by their check results, publicly available at <https://community.r-multiverse.org>.

## Continuous maintainer-driven deployment

Anyone can [contribute](contributors.md) packages to Community via GitHub.
Each package only needs to be registered once.

Every new [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) then automatically deploys to the repository without needing to go through R-multiverse again.
In other words, the package maintainer is in complete control.

This frictionless, maintainer-driven experience was made possible by the incredible infrastructure of [rOpenSci's R-universe system](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/).

## What about my personal R-universe?

R-multiverse perfectly complements your existing personal or organization R-universe.

This can continue to hold either development or release versions for yourself and your colleagues.
At the same time, R-multiverse deploys the latest package releases directly to the wider community.
