## The Community Repository for R packages

A traditional software version cycle begins with the development phase, where bugs are expected and ironed out, and ends with the production phase, which promises a seamless user experience.

R-multiverse Community currently aims at a space just before production, commonly referred to as Quality Assurance (QA). This means that:

1. Each package release has the full endorsement of its own maintainer. R-multiverse always provides a version that its developer chose to distribute for general use.
2. The user is still responsible for judging whether a package is appropriate to use. Some releases may still have issues, and these may be indicated by the check results at <https://community.r-multiverse.org>.

## Continuous maintainer-driven deployment

Each package only needs to be registered once. Every new [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) automatically deploys to <https://community.r-multiverse.org> without needing to go through R-multiverse again. In other words, the package maintainer is in complete control. This frictionless, maintainer-driven experience was made possible by the incredible infrastructure of [rOpenSci's R-universe system](https://community.r-multiverse.org).

## What about my personal R-universe?

R-multiverse perfectly complements your existing personal or organization R-universe. This can continue to hold either release or development versions for yourself and your colleagues. At the same time, R-multiverse deploys the latest package releases directly to the wider community.
